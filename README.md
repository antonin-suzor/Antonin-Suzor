## Greetings!
I'm Antonin Suzor, a french developer and student at EPITA, France's 2nd best CS engineering school.

I started studying IT because I wanted to make programs that would help people and make them happy.
Nowadays, my goal is to help teams reach their full potential, either by providing the right tools for them, or by managing them correctly.

## I'm interested in:
- Rust 🦀
- Java 🍵
- C ⚙️
- TypeScript 🟦
- SvelteKit 🟠
- Tauri 🔁
- Spring 🌱
- Quarkus ⚛️

I'd love to someday participate in an open-source project with multiple people, feel free to contact me in any way !

## About my repositories
Most of the repos here are just side-projects that I started someday and never really took the time to finish or polish.
Still, I've decided to make them public, because why not.
